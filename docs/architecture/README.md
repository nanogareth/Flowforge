# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the FlowForge platform architecture, split into three focused documents.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Platform Architecture](platform-architecture.md) | Universal layer — memory, hooks, token conservation, exploration persistence. Every project gets this. |
| [Workflow Presets](workflow-presets.md) | Configurable layer — 4 workflow presets (research, feature, greenfield, learning) and 5 stack configurations. |
| [FlowForge Integration](flowforge-integration.md) | FlowForge's role as scaffolder and command center. Template composition, mobile UX, CC web flow. |

## Reading Order

1. **Platform Architecture** — understand the foundation
2. **Workflow Presets** — understand what varies per project type
3. **FlowForge Integration** — understand how it all gets assembled and delivered

## Archive

The original unified design doc is preserved in `archive/research-workflow-system-design-v2.md`.
