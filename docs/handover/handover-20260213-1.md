# Session Handover — 2026-02-13 #1

## Status

- **Branch:** main
- **Last commit:** 43af338 chore: add eslint config, codebase map, test reports dir, and gitignore updates
- **Uncommitted changes:**
  - `flowforge-mobile/babel.config.js` — added `react-native-reanimated/plugin`
  - `flowforge-mobile/jest.config.js` — fixed setupFilesAfterEnv path
  - `flowforge-mobile/package.json` — new deps added via yarn (reanimated, eslint plugins)
  - `flowforge-mobile/yarn.lock` — new (migrated from package-lock.json)
  - `flowforge-mobile/package-lock.json` — deleted (replaced by yarn.lock)
  - Several untracked files: `WorkingTogether.txt`, `npx eslint.txt`, `yarn warnings.txt`, `docs/android-testing-guide.md`, `docs/greenfield-orientation.md`, root `package-lock.json`
- **Tests:** 0 passed, 0 failed (no test files exist yet; jest config is now valid)

## What Was Done

- **Fixed bundling error:** Installed `react-native-reanimated@4.1.6` (required by `react-native-css-interop` / NativeWind) and added its Babel plugin to `babel.config.js`
- **Fixed Jest config:** Changed `setupFilesAfterEnv` from `@testing-library/jest-native/extend-expect` (not installed) to `@testing-library/react-native/extend-expect` (built-in with v12+)
- **Fixed ESLint:** Installed missing `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` dev dependencies
- **GitHub OAuth:** User confirmed sign-in flow is working

## Decisions Made

- Used `yarn` as package manager (project already had yarn.lock from prior session)
- Used `npx expo install` for reanimated to get SDK 54-compatible version
- Kept `@testing-library/jest-native` out of dependencies — unnecessary with `@testing-library/react-native` v12+

## Open Issues

- **No test files exist yet** — jest is configured but `__tests__/` is empty
- **Untracked files need triage:** `WorkingTogether.txt`, `npx eslint.txt`, `yarn warnings.txt` appear to be scratch/debug files — consider deleting or gitignoring
- **Peer dependency warnings:** `expo-router` wants `@expo/metro-runtime@^6.1.2`; `@testing-library/react-native` wants `react-test-renderer>=16.8.0` — neither is blocking but worth resolving
- **Uncommitted changes should be committed** — babel config, jest config, and dependency fixes are all working

## Next Steps

1. Commit the dependency and config fixes from this session
2. Write initial test files (auth flow, store, template composition are good candidates)
3. Resolve peer dependency warnings (`@expo/metro-runtime`, `react-test-renderer`)
4. Clean up scratch files from repo root
5. Continue feature development (app is now bundling and OAuth is functional)
